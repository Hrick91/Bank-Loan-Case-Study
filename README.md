This project focuses on analysing a loan application dataset to gain insights into various factors affecting loan approval and defaults. 
The dataset includes a range of attributes related to the applicant's financials, personal details, and loan characteristics. 
We aim to address key data analysis tasks such as handling missing data, detecting outliers, understanding data imbalance, performing univariate and bivariate analysis, 
and identifying correlations between key variables and the target variable, which indicates whether the loan application was approved (TARGET).
The analysis is conducted using Excel 2019, which provides robust functionality to process, clean, and visualize data. Below is a breakdown of the 
methodologies used to address each task, followed by the results obtained through various analyses.
